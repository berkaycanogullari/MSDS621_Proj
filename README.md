# Can online customers' intention be predicted beforehand?

## Who am I?

My name is Berkay Canogullari. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at the University of San Francisco. At the same time, I'm working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of California, San Francisco!

## About the project

In this project I'm going to try to predict if a customer causes revenue to the company based on the features of the dataset and compare two fundamental ML algorithms. My main focus will be to show Scikit-Learn's general functionality and predictive power but **not** interpretability. I will explain what steps I took and why over the project notebook.
