# Can online customers' intention be predicted beforehand?

## Who am I?

I am Berkay Canogullari. I am currently working on my M.S. in Data Science at the University of San Francisco.

In this project I'm going to try to predict if a customer causes revenue to the company based on the features of the dataset and compare two fundamental ML algorithms. My main focus will be to show Scikit-Learn's general functionality and prediction but not interpretability. I will explain what steps I took and why over the notebook. Let's get started!
