# Can online customers' intention be predicted beforehand?


## Who am I?

My name is Berkay Canogullari. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at the University of San Francisco. At the same time, I'm working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of California, San Francisco!


## About the project

In this project I'm going to try to predict if a customer causes revenue to the company based on the features of the dataset and compare two fundamental ML algorithms. My main focus will be to show Scikit-Learn's general functionality and predictive power but **not** interpretability. I will explain what steps I took and why over the project notebook.


## Why is it important?

Customers who arenâ€™t making a purchase can be analyzed in detail and further action can be taken accordingly to increase revenue


## Findings

1) As expected, Random Forest algorithm performed better than logistic regression with little hyperparameter tuning
2) Time to do hyperparameter search with cross validation for Random Fores was relatively longer than the Logistic Regression model
3)
